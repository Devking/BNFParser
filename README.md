BNF (Backus-Naur Form) Math Expressions Parser
==============================================

Overview
--------

This repository tracks my progress in developing a BNF recursive-descent parser to evaluate mathematical expressions.

This project stems from an assignment that I had to program for a graduate Programming Languages course. The main challenge of that assignment was to pick up a new language (Ruby) and create a recursive descent parser in that language.

Prior to this assignment, I had been used to dealing with mathematical expressions in C++ by using push-down automata to convert expressions from infix notation to postfix notation before evaluating. The primary goal of this assignment was to expand my horizons with parsing (and pick up new languages along the way). This is also an attempt to add more to my GitHub and practice working with Markdown documentation for my projects.

| assignedparser.rb | Ruby            | The original script written for the course.     |
| fullparser.rb     | Ruby            | A modified parser to make more practical sense. |
| pushdown.cpp      | C++             | An approach at parsing using pushdown automata. |

### Script Breakdowns

#### assignedparser.rb

This uses a BNF-inspired approach to parse and evaluate mathematical expressions with proper order of operations. However, this is the original version assigned from my course, with peculiar objectives that needed to be fulfilled. *This version does not work for division or exponentiation.*

Below are sample cases of input and output for this script. Input is taken from standard in, and output is sent to standard out. 

*Here's where some of the oddities are:* No output will be generated until the input has ended (signaled by EOF). If any of the input format is incorrect, the output will simply generate the "ERR" message. "QUIT" with a newline must be placed after all expressions for the input to be formatted correctly.

These oddities and limitations are corrected in the **fullparser.rb** script.

##### Sample Input/Output

**Case 1:**

```
1+3 * 5 + 10
(5 - -5)
QUIT
```

```
26
10
```

This case works correctly. Note that spacing and tabbing is ignored by the parser.
Note that you can input as many '-' as you wish, as they will be evaluated as "negation."

**Case 2:**

```
1+1+1
```

```
ERR
```

This case gives the ERR message, because no QUIT was present at the end of the input.

**Case 3:**

```
3+5+6+7
(4+5+(6)
QUIT
```

```
ERR
```

This case gives the ERR message, because there is a missing left parenthesis in the second line.

#### fullparser.rb

This uses a BNF-inspired approach to parse and evaluate mathematical expressions with proper order of operations. This is a modification of the **assignedparser.rb** script in order to be more sensible in practical use.

Still working on documenting  sample input/output cases.

#### pushdown.cpp

This uses an old-school pushdown automata to convert the mathematical expressions entered in infix notation to postfix notation, so that they can be evaluated non-ambiguously. This code stems from my prior experience in C++ and working closely with the Data Structures and Algorithms course (which I have TA'ed for, for two years now), which covers this topic.

Still working on documenting  sample input/output cases.
